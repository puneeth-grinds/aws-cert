# DEPLOYMENT SCALE AND MANAGING INFRASTRUCTURE

## CLOUD FORMATION

- **It is a declarative way of defining AWS infrastructure**
- Benefits are:
    - **IaC**
    - Cost - Resource creation and termination can be automated
    - Generated diagram for our template
    - Leverage existing templates

## AWS CLOUD DEVELOPMENT KIT (CDK)
- Defining **cloud infrastructure using a familiar programming language**
- Code is **compiled into a cloudformation template**
![CDK](assets/image-1.png)

## AWS ELASTIC BEANSTALK - PaaS
- Generally we make use of 3 tier for Web application, that is, ELB -> EC2 -> DB
- Elastic beanstalk is a **developer centric view of deploying an application to AWS**
- **BEANSTALK - PaaS**
- Here, the **developer manages the code while AWS is responsible for deployment and management**
- **ELASTIC BEANSTALK HAS ITS OWN HEALTH MONITORING** 

## AWS CODE DEPLOY
- It is a **HYBRID SERVICE - ONPREM AND CLOUD**
- It is a way to **deploy applications automatically**
- It helps with **UPGRADING APPLICATIONS FROM V1 TO V2 IN A FEW CLICKS**

## AWS CODECOMMIT
- It is a **code repository, using the git technology**
- CodeCommit is a way of **storing code before moving it to deployment in AWS**
- Private, secure

## AWS CODEBUILD
- **SERVERLESS**
- Build code in the cloud
- **Compile source code, test and the output which is a package can be deployed**
- **PAY FOR TIME USED TO BUILD THE CODE**

## AWS CODEPIPELINE
- **We can connect CodeCommit and CodeBuild using a CodePipeline**
- It is the basis for **CI/CD**
- Code -> Build -> Test -> Deploy

## OVERALL WORKFLOW

![alt text](assets/image-2.png)

## AWS CODE ARTIFACT

- Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called **ARTIFACT MANAGEMENT**
- **Developers and CodeBuild can retrieve dependencies from CodeArtifact**

## AWS SSM - SYSTEM MANAGER

> **Priority: 🔴 HIGH**

# GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
- Deploying application in multiple regions or Edge locations making it a global application 
- Reasons:
    - Decreased Latency
    - Disaster recovery 
    - Attack protection

## AMAZON ROUTE 53
- It is a managed DNS(Domain name system)
- It helps clients reach their correct destination by providing an IP address
![alt text](assets/image-3.png)

### ROUTING POLICIES:
1. **SIMPLE ROUTING POLICY**
- No health checks 
-  it simply goes to DNS and gets the IP

2. **WEIGHTED ROUTING POLICY**
- We do have health-checks
-  allows us to distribute weights across multiple EC2 instances
![alt text](assets/image-4.png)

3. **LATENCY ROUTING POLICY**
- Checks the user's location and redirects the request to the nearest server 


4. **FAILOVER ROUTING POLICY**
- we will have primary and failover instances
- DNS performs a health check on primary and then routes to failover if primary is unhealthy 

## CLOUDFRONT OVERVIEW
- It is a **CDN - CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK**
- it **caches the content across Points of presence or Edge locations**
- We get **DDoS protection**
- Cloudfront has origins like S3, so for the first time. Edge location gets from origin and stores in cache for the next times 

## AWS S3 TRANSFER ACCELERATOR
- Increases upload and download speeds for S3 buckets
- When we need to upload a file from Australia to a bucket in England, then during the process it gets uploaded to a edge location first and through a **internal network** it gets uploaded to bucket in England super fast

## AWS GLOBAL ACCELERATOR
- Here we leverage, **AWS internal network to optimize the route to our application**
- We access applications through **static IP**
- We **connect to an Edge location and from there we move internal**

## AWS OUTPOSTS
- It is about **HYBRID CLOUD**
- **Outposts are server racks that offers same AWS infrastructure services on On-prem**
- **AWS will setup and manage**
- But we will be responsible for security of the server racks 

## AWS WAVELENGTH
- Able to deploy few AWS services on edge of 5G networks
- ultra-low latency through 5G networks

## AWS LOCAL ZONES
**EXTEND VPC's IN A REGION TO LOCAL ZONES**
- **Place AWS compute storage or databases closer to users**
- Extend your VPC to more locations **Extension of AWS regions**
- Basically, we can extend a local zone for a region and then host our EC2 there for better latency and availability


> **Priority: 🔴 HIGH**

# CLOUD INTEGRATIONS
- There are 2 ways of application communicating each other:
    1. Synchronous communication (Application to Application)
    2. Asynchronous/Event based (Application -> Queue -> Application)

## AWS SQS
- **SQS = Simple Queue Service**
- Producers send messages to a Queue and once it is stored in queue, consumers can poll these messages and complete the work
- Once completed, the message will be deleted in the queue
- **SERVERLESS**
- It is used to **DECOUPLE APPLICATIONS**
- default retention is **4 days to 14 days**
- **It used FIFO - FIRST IN FIRST OUT**
- Example:
![alt text](assets/image5.png)

## AWS KINESIS DATASTREAM
- It is used to **collect and analyze live streaming data**

## AWS SNS
- **SNS = Simple notification service**
- Sending a single message to thousands of users
- **PUB/SUB INTEGRATION**
- Publishers will send messages to **SINGLE SNS TOPIC** and **SUBSCRIBERS TO THAT SNS TOPIC** will get message from that 
![alt text](assets/image6.png)

## AMAZON MQ
- **SQS and SNS are cloud native**
- **On-Prem** makes use of **MQTT** etc.
- so **when migrated to cloud, to continue with those servers we make use of AMAZON MQ**


> **Priority: 🔴 HIGH**

# CLOUD MONITORING

- We can collect logs from:
    - EBS
    - ECS
    - Route53
- We can also configure log retention 

### CLOUD WATCH LOGS FOR EC2
- By default, it will not send logs; we need to install an agent and then we can send what logs needs to be sent '

## EVENT BRIDGE 
- **schedule Cron Jobs**
- We can react to event occuring and also for a service happening 
- Example: Give a alert to security group if a user is logging in through a Root user
![alt text](assets/image7.png)

## AWS CLOUDTRAIL
- It **provides governance, compliance, and auditing for an AWS account** 
- Everything that is done in an account will be logged in cloudtrail.

- Gives alert on schedules maintainence from AWS etc


> **Priority: 🔴 HIGH**

# VPC AND NETWORKING 

## IP ADDRESSES IN AWS
- IPv4 - 4.3 billion addresses
- Ipv6 - almost unlimited (3.4 * 10^38)
- EC2 instances get a new IP every time we start and stop - **PUBLIC IP ADDRESS**

**Private IPv4** - It is not public and will be the same even if we stop and restart and cannot be accessed by internet
- ### ELASTIC IP - Gets a fixed public IPv4 address for an EC2 instance


- IPv6 is free on AWS while EIP and Ipv4 charges 0.005$

## VPC - VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD
- **It is linked to a Region**
- **Subnets** - **Part of a VPC and associated with an AZ**
- Here we can have:
    1. **Public Subnet** - accessed by public
    2. **Private subnet** - cannot be accessed by public 
![alt text](assets/image-8.png)

## INTERNET GATEWAY

- It can go to S3 or cloudwatch logs

## VPC PEERING
- connecting 2 VPCs privately using AWS network
- Must not have **overlapping CIDRs**
- VPC peering is not **TRANSITIVE IN NATURE**

## VPC ENDPOINTS
- Endpoints allow you to **connect to AWS services using a private network**
- It ensures we have:
    - Better security 
    - low latency 
- ### VPC ENDPOINT GATEWAY IS FOR S3 AND DYNAMODB ALONE FOR OTHERS IT IS VPC ENDPOINT INTERFACE

## AWS PRIVATELINK 
- **It is the most secure and scalable way to expose a service to thousands of VPC's**
- **It allows a service running in your VPC to be exposed to other VPC's**
![alt text](assets/image10.png)

## SITE TO SITE VPN
- **Connecting an on-premises data centre to VPC on AWS we use SITE TO SITE VPN**
- It goes over public internet 
- We need **CUSTOMER GATEWAY** ON **CUSTOMER SIDE** and **VIRTUAL PRIVATE GATEWAY** on AWS side

## DIRECT CONNECT
- Establishes a physical connection between On-Prem and AWS
- But more **private and secure and expensive**

## AWS CLIENT VPN
- connects your computer using **OpenVPN** to your VPC
- It goes over to internet and if VPC is connected to On-prem we can access On-prem as well 

## TRANSIT GATEWAY
- It helps in **connecting thousands of VPCs**
- **VPC PEERING WAS TOO HECTIC AND CREATED COMPLEX NETWORK TOPOLOGY** and hence we used Transit Gateway


> **Priority: 🔴 HIGH**
