\# **AWS - CLOUD PRACTITIONER PAGE 1**

\### **WHAT IS A SERVER COMPOSED OF?**
1\. CPU
2\. RAM-Memory
3\. Storage - Database
4\. Networking Aspects - Routers, DNS etc.

\### **WORKFLOW**
\- Client will send data through a Router using Internet. Client and Server have their own IP addresses
\- Router is responsible for routing the data packet to a Switch.
\- Switch is responsible for sending the data packet to the right server 

\### **TRADITIONAL IT APPROACH / DATA CENTRES DISADVANTAGES**
1\. Pay rent for data centre
2\. Power supeopley, cooling was a concern
3\. Adding and replacing hardware - MAINTENANCE
4\. Scaling is LIMITED

\## **WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?**
\- It is the **\*\*on-demand delivery\*\*** of compute power, database storage, apeopleications and other IT resources.
\- **\*\*pay-as-you-go pricing\*\***
\- Access almost these resources **\*\*instantly\*\***

\### **NOTE: WE NEVER PAY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE, WE PAY FOR THE RESOURCES USED.**

\## **DEPLOYMENT MODELS IN CLOUD**
1\. ### **PRIVATE CLOUD**
\- Private infrastructure
\- Cloud service is not exposed to public 
\- Complete control
\- More security 

2\. ### **PUBLIC CLOUD**
\- AWS, GCP and Azure
\- Cloud services are owned and operated by third-party
\- They are delivered over internet

3\. ### **HYBRID CLOUD** 
1\. Private + Public cloud
2\. Few services On-prem while some are on Cloud

\## **FIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF CLOUD COMPUTING A**
1\. Completely **\*\*ON-DEMAND\*\***
2\. Broad Network Access
3\. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling  - Multiple customers can use the same services having complete privacy
4\. Rapid Elasticity and Scalability - Quickly and easily scalable 
5\. Measured services

\## **SIX ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD**
1\. Tade **\*\*CAPITAL EXPENSES FOR OPERATIONAL EXPENSES, CAPEX FOR OPEX\*\*** 
2\. Benefit of scaling 
3\. stop guessing capaciy 
4\. Increased speed and agility
5\. stop spending money and running data centres

\## **DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLOUD COMPUTING** 

1\. ### **INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE - IaaS**
\- Provides **\*\*networking, computers, data storage space\*\***
\- Highest level of flexibility
\- Provide building blocks for cloud IT.
\- EC2

2\. ### **PLATFORM AS A SERVICE - PaaS**
\- Remove the need to manage the underlying infrastructure
\- Manage on deployment and managing apeopleications
\- Elastic Beanstalk

3\. ### **SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE - SaaS**
\- Completed product that is run and managed by service providers
\- Gmail

\### **ON-PREM WE MANAGE:**
1\. Apeopleications 
2\. Data
3\. Runtime
4\. Middleware
5\. OS
6\. Virtulization
7\. Servers
8\. Storage
9\. Networking 

\### **IaaS**
1\. Apeopleications
2\. Data
3\. Runtime
4\. Middleware
5\. OS is maintained by us, rest is done by CSP

\### **PaaS**
1\. Apeopleication
2\. Data
\- Is managed by rest is done by CSP


\## **PRICING ON CLOUD**
\- It is mainly pay-as-you-go but it depends 
1\. COMPUTE - Pay for compute time 
2\. Storage - Data stored
3\. Network - Pay when Data transfer is outside of cloud

\## **AWS REGIONS**
\- Regions have name. Example:  us-east-1
\- It is a cluster of data centres
\- **\*\*MOST SERVICES ARE REGION SPECIFIC\*\***

\### **HOW TO CHOOSE A AWS REGION** 
1\. **\*\*Compliance\*\*** - Sometimes Govt needs your data to be local 
2\. **\*\*Latency\*\*** - Close to users
3\. **\*\*Available services\*\*** - Not all regions have all services
4\. **\*\*Pricing\*\***

\## **AVAILABILITY ZONES**
\- Minimum is **\*\*3 and Maximum is 6\*\***
\- It consists of one or more discrete data centres
\- They're separated from eachother, to avoid disasters

\## **AWS POINTS OF PRESENCE OR EDGE LOCATIONS**
\- Have more than 400 
\- It is used by CDNs to provide low latency

> **Priority: 🔴 HIGH**

\# **IAM SECTION**

\- IAM - IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 
\- It is a global service
\- **\*\*USERS\*\*** - People within in organization 
\- **\*\*GROUP\*\*** - People can be grouped

\### **NOTE: Group contains users, and a single user can belong to multiple groups**
\- These groups and users are assigned permissions to ensure which services can be accessed and which should be restricted.

\- **\*\*LEAST PREVILIGE PERMISSION\*\*** - Not to give more permissions than needed

\## **IAM POLICIES INHERITANCE**
\- Attaching policy at a group level apeopleies policy to everyone in the group 
\- **\*\*INLINE POLICY\*\*** used for apeopleying policy for a user not in any group 
\- IAM policy consists of:
    \- Version 
    \- ID
    \- Statement
    \- SID - Statement ID
    \- Affect - allow or deny
    \- Principal - Account, user or role 
    \- Action - List of API calls
    \- Resources - List of resources to which the action will be apeopleied 

\### **IAM PASSWORD POLICY**
\- Stronger password = More security
\- We can configure a customized password policy:
    \- Number of characters
    \- character case
    \- non-alphanumeric characters
    \- Allow IAM users to change their own password

\### **MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION** 
\- MFA is a combination of **\*\*password we know + secruity device we own\*\***

\### **MFA OPTIONS**
1\. Virtual MFA device - Google authenticator, Authy
2\. Universal 2nd Factor - U2F security device - **\*\*Yubikey\*\*** is an example 

\### **HOW CAN USERS ACCESS AWS**
1\. AWS CONSOLE - Protected by MFA and password
2\. CLI - command line interface
3\. SDK - AWS Software development kit - Code

\- CLI and SDK are protected by **\*\*Access Keys\*\***

\- Similar to terminal in CLI, we can use Cloudshell. But it is important to note that Cloudshell is not available for all regions 

\## **IAM ROLES FOR SERVICES**
\- Some AWS services need permissions to perform certain operations 
\- So we use **\*\*IAM ROLES\*\***

\## **IAM SECURITY TOOLS**
\- **\*\*IAM Credentials report\*\*** - a report that lists all your account users and the status of their credentials 

\- **\*\*IAM ACCESS ADVISOR\*\*** - Shows service permissions granted to a user and when they were last accessed

\## **IAM BEST PRACTICES**
\- Principle of least privilege
\- Assign users to groups
\- Create a strong password
\- Create Roles fore giving permissions to AWS services


\## **SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL**
AWS is responsible for:
\- Infrastructure and security
    \- Config and vulnerability analysis
We are responsible for:
\- Creating roles
    \- enabling MFA
    \- Assigning permissions
    \- Rotate keys often

> **Priority: 🔴 HIGH**

\# **EC2 INSTANCES** 

\- EC2 instances are capable of:
    1\. Renting VM's
    2\. Storing data 
    3\. Distribute load across

\- Operating system offered: Linux, Windows and Mac OS
\- CPU
\- RAM
\- Network attached - EFS & EBS
\-  Networking and Security group

\- **\*\*BOOTSTRAPPING\*\*** - means launching commands when a machine starts 
\- It runs only once at the instance start 
\- It does installing updates, softwares etc.
\- EC2 runs as a root user

\### **NAMING CONVENTION**
\- m5.2xlarge

\- m - instance class
\- 5 - Generation
\- 2xlarge - Size

\## **EC2 INSTANCE TYPES**

1\. ### **GENERAL PURPOSE** 
\-  **\*\*Great for webservers and code repo\*\***
\- Balance between:
    \- compute
    \- memory
    \- network

2\. ### **COMPUTE OPTIMIZED**
\- Great for **\*\*compute-intensive tasks\*\***
\- Requires **\*\*high performance processors\*\***
\- Example: Batch processing workloads, dedicated gaming servers, machine learning 
\- They are of name C

3\. ### **MEMORY OPTIMIZED**

\- They are used for :
    \- High performance, relational and non relational databases
    \- In-memory **\*\*databases optimized for BI\*\***

4\. ### **STORAGE OPTIMIZED**
\- Great for **\*\*storage-intensive tasks\*\***, for reading and writing large data sets 
\- Uses cases:
    \- **\*\*OLTP\*\***
    \- Relational & NoSQL databases 
    \- Cache for in-memory databases

\## **INTRODUCTION TO SECURITY GROUPS**
\- They will **\*\*control how traffic will move IN & OUT\*\*** of the Ec2 instances
\- They have rules that refer to an IP address or a Security Group 
\- They regulate to:
    \- Access to ports
    \- Validate IP range 
    \- control inbound and outbound network

\### **NOTE: SECURITY GROUP BY DEFAULT WILL ALLOW OUTBOUND RULE** 

\- Security groups can be attached to multiple instances
\- Locked down to a region or a VPC combination 
\- It is a good practise to maintain a separate security group for SSH

\### **CLASSIC PORTS TO KNOW** 
1\. SSH - Port 22
2\. FTP - Port 21
3\. SFTP - Port 22
4\. HTTPS - Port 443
5\. RDP - 3389
6\. HTTP - 80

\### **SSH SUMMARY TABLE** 
\- For Linux servers, we can use this
\- We connect **\*\*inside our servers\*\*** to perform maintaience
\- SSH can be used for Mac, Linux and then Windows >=10
\- We can use **\*\*Putty for Windows < 10\*\***
\- EC2 instance connect - Available for all( Mac, Windows and Linux)

\### **RULE OF THUMB - NEVER ENTER ACCESS KEY AND ACCESS SECRET IN EC2 INSTANCE**
\- Instead use **\*\*IAM ROLES\*\***

\## **EC2 INSTANCES PURCHASING OPTIONS** 

\## **EC2 ON DEMAND**
\- **\*\*Linux or Windows - Billing per second\*\*** 
\- For all billing per hour
\- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment 
\- No commitments

\## **EC2 RESERVED INSTANCES**
\- **\*\*72% discount\*\*** compared to On-Demand 
\- We reserve a specific type of instances (Regions, Os )
\- Payment - No upfront, partial upfront and All upfront 
\- **\*\*Scope: Region or Zone\*\***
\- Can BUY AND SELL in market place

\## **EC2 SAVINGS**
\- same 7**\*\*2% savings\*\*** compared to On-demand 
\- Commit to a certain type of usage
\- Example: **\*\*I want to use 10$ per hour for next 3 years\*\***
\- Anything above savings plan is **\*\*On-demand\*\***

\## **EC2 SPOT INSTANCES**
\- **\*\*90%\*\*** discount 
\- Instances can be lost, as we define a max price we can pay. Once moved out it will be terminated 
\- Not suited for critical workloads

\## **EC2 DEDICATED HOSTS**

    \- Security group roles
    \- IAM roles
    \- OS patches
    \- Data security 

\## **STORAGE FOR EC2 INSTANCES**

1\. ### **EBS - ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE**

\- It acts as a **\*\*NETRWORK volume\*\*** that is attached to EC2 instances
\- They store the data even after termination 
\- They can be **\*\*mounted only to a single EC2 instance\*\***
\- They are bound to specific **\*\*AVAILABILITY ZONE\*\***
\- Example: An EBS created us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b, but **\*\*we can move volumes across AZ\*\***

2\. ### **EBS SNAPSHOT**
\- We can take a EBS and perform a **\*\*snapshot = BACKUP\*\***
\- We can COPY **\*\*SNAPSHOTS ACROSS REGIONS AND AZ\*\***

\### **EBS SNAPSHOT ARCHIVE**
\- 75% cheaper to store an snapshot 
\- Takes 24 to 72 hours for a restore

\## **AMI OVERVIEW**
\- AMI = **\*\*AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE\*\***
\- We can customize an EC2 using AMI
\- We can install softwares, configs and OS.
\- AMI are built for a **\*\*specific region\*\*** and can be copied

\## **EC2 IMAGE BUILDER**
\- **\*\*Automated creation of VM's and Container images\*\***
\- EC2 image builder creates a Builder EC2 instances where we customizeize and then a our custom AMI will be created. EC2 builder will perform tests on it 
\- And then we can use it 
\- It can be **\*\*run on a schedule\*\***

\## **EC2 INSTANCE STORE**
\- Since EBS volumes are network volumes and are limited. WE can use EC2 instance store 
\- And EC2 Instance **\*\*LOSE THEIR DATA IF STORED\*\***

\## **EFS - ELASTIC FILE SYSTEM**
\- This can be attached to EC2 instances (shared network file system)
\- It can be **\*\*mounted to 100s of EC2 instances\*\***
\- Works for **\*\*LINUX EC2\*\***
\- Expensive 
\- It can be attached **\*\*ACROSS AZ\*\***

\## **EBS vs EFS**
1\. EBS one instance and one AZ, EFS can be done in other way. But we can move EBS to different AZ using Snapcshot

\## **EFS-IA**
\- Cost optimized, **\*\*92% discount\*\*** 
\- Files that are not accessed frequently 
\- We can create policy, Like *\*If a file not accessed for 60 days, move to EFS-IA\**

\## **SHARED RESPONSIBILITY**

> **Priority: 🔴 HIGH**

\# **ELASTIC LOAD BALANCING AND AUTO SCALING** 
\### **SCALABILITY** 
\- Means apeopleication can handle greater loads by adapting 
\- There are two kinds:
    \- Vertical scaling 
    \- Horizontal scaling = Elasticity
\### **VERTICAL SCALING** 
\- **\*\*SCALE UP OR DOWN\*\***
\- Increase the size 
\- Example; t2.micro to t2.large
\- Example: Database
\- Limit of hardware

\### **HORIZONTAL SCALING**
\- **\*\*SCALE OUT AND SCALE IN\*\***
\- Increasing the number of systems / EC2 instances
\- We need a distributed system 

\## **HIGH AVAILABILITY**
\- Goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling 
\- **\*\*RUNNING IN ATLEAST 2 AZ\*\***

\### **SCALBILITY - ACCOMMODATE LARGER LOAD (SCALE UP AND DOWN)**
\### **ELASTICITY - AUTO SCALING (SCALE OUT AND SCALE IN)**
\### **AGILITY - REDUCE TIME AND FASTER**

\## **WHAT IS LOAD BALANCING** 
\- Servers that forward Internet traffic to multiple EC2 instances based on workload
\- We can use **\*\*across multiple AZs\*\***
\- AWS takes care of ALB and we are responsible for configuring.
\- 4 Kind of load balancers
    \- ALB - Apeopleication Load balancers - HTTP and HTTPS - **\*\*Layer 7\*\***
    \- NLB - Network Load balacners - **\*\*Layer 4\*\***
    \- GATEWAY LOAD BALANCER - **\*\*Layer 3\*\*** **\*\*GENEVE protocol\*\***

![Load balancers]\(image-2.png)

\## **AUTO-SCALING GROUPS**
\- In real-life, the load on websites can change and hence 
\- ASG can scale out and scale in based on the number of requests coming in 
\- ASG can terminate unhealthy EC2 instances and replace them with healthy EC2

\## **AUTO SCALING STRATEGIES**
1\. ### **MANUAL SCALING**
\- Scale manually

2\. ### **DYNAMIC SCALING** 
\- Do when a certain event occur like a cloudwatch trigger
\- **\*\*TARGET SCALING\*\*** - I want the average CPU to stay around 40%

3\. ### **SCHEDULED SCALING** 
\- Anticipating ahead of time 

4\. ### **PREDICTIVE SCALING** 
\- Use ML for past patterns and scale accordingly
